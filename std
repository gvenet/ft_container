Map is of size 1: (chat,Ã§a va ?)

Should be ordered : (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4)

Map is : (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4)
Iterator is ponting at (2,2)
Erasing keys 1 and 3
Iterator is ponting at (2,2)
it++;
Iterator is ponting at (4,4)
it--; it--;
Iterator is ponting at (0,0)

Before swap:
m1 = (0,0) and m2 = 
After swap:
m1 = and m2 = (0,0)
Address before and after are equal ? true
